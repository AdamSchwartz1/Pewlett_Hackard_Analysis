# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to help Pewlett Hackard analyze the amount of employees that will be retiring soon so that they could adequately plan for their future. I looked at employees that were born between 1962 and 1965 and broke them down by their current job titles. I also assisted them with identifying eligible candidates for the mentorship program that they will use to select current employees to mentor the new wave of of team members.

Applications used: PostgreSQL and Quick Database Diagrams

## Results
Here are 4 key takeaways from the analysis I completed:
- The most common position being vacated is Senior Engineer with 29,414 people up for retirement soon.
- The least common position is Manager, with 2 people. So Pewlett Hackard won't have to put much emphasis on finding managers.

- There are 1,549 people eligible for the mentorship program.
- There are 90,398 positions that will be vacated and 1,549 potential mentors. Meaning there is a 58:1 ratio of open poistions to mentors - not accounting for job title.

## Summary
I have listed two critical questions that we can begin to discuss with the provided analysis for the upcoming "silver tsunami".

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
- There are 90,398 positions that will need to be filled in the near future if the current organization structure stays intact. With all of this turnover, this is a prime opportunity to do further analysis to see if all these rolls need to be filled or if there is a more streamlined structure that better fits today's business needs.

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
- I don't believe there are enough people eligible for this mentorship program. I think it's safe to say that not everyone will want to participate in this program either so the number of individuals willing to become a mentor could be significantly less than the amount eligible. Additionally, the current plan is for them to have part-time rolls which will not provide adequate time to mentor all of the new employees.

There are two additional tables that I think would be beneficial to plan for the silver tsunami:
1. The first table would be to identify individuals who are eligible for a promotion. We could look for people who are in a non-senior rolls (i.e. engineer and staff) for more than 5 years and were born after the year 1970. This will allow Pewlett Hackard to fill some of the senior rolls from within and reward some long time employees while also creating some more entry level jobs that may be easier to fill.
2. The second table would be to examine the next wave of retiring employees. This would be individuals born from 1966 to 1969. This table would be helpful for the future planning of the company and to get a well designed plan in place for the next wave of retirees.
