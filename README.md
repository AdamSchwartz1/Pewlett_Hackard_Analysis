# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to help Pewlett Hackard analyze the amount of employees that will be retiring soon so that they could adequately plan for their future. I looked at employees that were born between 1962 and 1965 and broke them down by their current job titles. I also assisted them with identifying eligible candidates for the mentorship program that they will use to select current employees to mentor the new wave of of team members.

Applications used: PostgreSQL and Quick Database Diagrams

## Results
Here are 4 key takeaways from the analysis I completed:
- The most common position being vacated is Senior Engineer with 29,414 people up for retirement soon.
- The least common position is Manager, with 2 people. So Pewlett Hackard won't have to put much emphasis on finding managers.

- There are 1,549 people eligible for the mentorship program
- There are 90,398 positions that will be vacated and 1,549 potential mentors. Meaning there is a 58:1 ratio of open poistions to mentors - not accounting for job title.

## Summary
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
